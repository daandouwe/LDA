# Latent Dirichlet Allocation

LDA with different flavours of inference. Speed thanks to Cython.
* Collapsed Gibbs sampling
* (Online) variational inference
* `coming up` Autoencoding variational inference ('amortized')

# TODO
* Clean up!
* Add references to borrowed code / inspiration.

# Extensions
* Correlated LDA using Gibbs sampling with Polya-Gamma Augmentation, following [Dependent Multinomial Models Made Easy: Stick Breaking with the Po ÃÅlya-Gamma Augmentation](https://hips.seas.harvard.edu/files/linderman-dependent-nips-2015.pdf)
